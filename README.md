# GlitchImageArraysP5
##by Ashley Woon
###A P5.js sketch creating an interactive, non-predictive, and erratic array of images. The sketch is meant to be viewed using a localhost.
###For all the p5.js sketches, when running under Chrome, you can do View->Developer Source->Java Console to see console information
###In the Terminal Window type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 or type: python -m http.server 8080 if you have Python version 3.
###In your web-browser (testing in Chrome): http://localhost:8080/
###This should display p5.js sketch

####Note: I'm using 8080 as the port, but this can be other numbers as well.
